# cobra
Continuation of [Hybrid](https://github.com/gloggers99/hybric) with improved and continued code. 
___

## Dependencies
To keep cobra as lean as possible we use as little dependencies as we can
- GLFW (considering switching to SDL3_opengl)
- GLM
- FreeType

## Features
- [X] Lightning fast OBJ file loading, leverages pre-allocation or file-streaming depending on size
- [X] Shader embedding for automatic header-like inclusion
- [X] Declarative rendering design (app structure and more)

## Why
I really wanted to make a game, I can't stand Unity or Godot or any mainstream game engine so I decided to make my own from scratch.
